## by (Ahmed Essam)


## Dataset

>- The Ford-Go Bikes dataset contains information about every trip that was made in february 2019 and has many variable such as trip duration and member age, type(customer or subscriber), gender .... etc. 
>- I couldn't upload the data as used in the notebooks because of their size and I cannot upload files greater than 25mb so, I compressed them and then uploaded them as a .rar files that you can find here in this repositories

## Summary of Findings

>- On Thursday between 5:00 and 6:00 PM the most bike rides are started, compared to the whole week and other hours.
>- Over the whole day, more male biker starts their trip than female riders with data peaks at 8:00 to 9:00 AM and 17:00 to 18:00 PM.
>- Over the whole day, more Subscriber (Member) starts their bike rides with data peaks at 8:00 to 9:00 AM and 17:00 to 18:00 PM.
>- Thursday has the most male and female bikers compared to other days. It also has the most Subscriber bikers compared to other days.
>- The weekend has the lowest frequency of bike rides in term of gender and user type compared to the rest of the week.
>- Most of the bikers are younger than 40 years across the whole week.
>- On the weekend the bike trips are on average longer compared to the trips on other days.
